Melting ice sheets is one of the most cliché signifiers of global warming and the climate crisis — but clichés originate in the truth, after all, and ice sheets are still melting. In fact, new research has found that the rate of global ice loss — aka melting ice sheets — is higher than ever before.

On Monday, Jan. 25, 2021, researchers from the University of Leeds, the University of Edinburgh, University College London, and Earthwave published their findings in European Geosciences Union’s journal The Cryosphere.

Climate change is playing out twice as fast in the boreal forest than it is on the rest of the planet. Permafrost is thawing, and vegetation is changing as climatic zones migrate north faster than trees can adapt. Already, dramatic change can be glimpsed from space: The tundra is turning green, while the boreal forest is turning brown.

In discussions on climate change, we tend to focus on carbon dioxide (CO2)- the most dominant greenhouse gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels, industrial production, and land use change. We cover CO2- global emissions, annual, cumulative, per capita, and consumption-based emissions- in great detail in our CO2 emissions page. But CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas that is driving global climate change. There are a number of others- methane, nitrous oxide, and trace gases such as the group of ‘F-gases’- which have contributed a significant amount of warming to date.
