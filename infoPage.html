                Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend
                has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to
                the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels
                burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the
                “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected
                off the surface cannot escape back into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the
                heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water
                vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global
                temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Global warming has presented another issue called climate change. Sometimes these phrases are used
                interchangeably, however, they are different. Climate change refers to changes in weather patterns and
                growing seasons around the world. It also refers to sea level rise caused by the expansion of warmer
                seas and melting ice sheets and glaciers. Global warming causes climate change, which poses a serious
                threat to life on Earth in the forms of widespread flooding and extreme weather. Scientists continue to
                study global warming and its impact on Earth.

                    The bulk of the world's scientific community is in agreement that our planet is becoming warmer and
                    that one of the main factors of global warming is human activity. Scientists agree that the release
                    of gases that prevent the dissipation of ground heat into space – a phenomenon known as the
                    greenhouse effect – is responsible. The gases primarily responsible for global warming include water
                    vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Humans produce them by
                    burning fossil fuels and engaging in various agricultural and industrial activities. The Earth
                    itself also contributes with natural processes that create greenhouse gases and accelerate the
                    warming trend.
                </p>


                <h2 class="mt-5">
                    Greenhouse Gases Are the Main Reasons for Global Warming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although carbon dioxide receives the most press as the culprit responsible for global warming, water
                    vapor is actually the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide still deserves
                    its notoriety, however. It may be a minor component of the atmosphere, but its increased abundance
                    is contributing to the warming trend, according to NASA. Humans exacerbate the problem by cutting
                    trees that absorb this gas and by adding other greenhouse gases to the mixture over and above those
                    that enter through natural processes. In addition, one of the global warming causes might be
                    astronomical.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">
                    Cause #1: Variations in the Sun's Intensity
                </h2>

                <p>

                    The Earth receives its warmth from the sun, so it's reasonable to suspect that our home star may be
                    one of the reasons for global warming. Although the amount of energy coming from the sun does vary
                    and may have been responsible for warming in the past, however, NASA and the Intergovernmental Panel
                    on Climate Change (IPCC) have ruled this out as a cause of the current warming trend. The average
                    energy coming from the sun generally has remained constant since 1750, and the warming does not
                    occur uniformly throughout the atmosphere. The upper layer is actually cooling as the bottom layer
                    becomes warmer.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">
                    Cause #3: Agricultural Activity
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The agricultural practices that produce food for the people on earth is another of the human causes
                    of climate change. The use of both commercial and organic fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, a
                    powerful greenhouse gas. Methane, another important greenhouse gas, comes from many natural sources,
                    but also from the digestive systems of livestock raised for meat production as well as the
                    decomposition of waste in landfills and the burning of biomass.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">
                    Cause #4: Deforestation
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The increased demand for meat and dairy cattle has lead to the creation of feed lots in otherwise
                    forested areas. Logging for wood and paper and clearing for crop production also requires trees to
                    be cut, sometimes illegally. One mature tree absorbs as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each
                    year, and by one estimate, 3.5 to 7 billion are cut every year. According to Scientific American,
                    deforestation is responsible for 15 percent of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

                    Cause #5: Earth's Own Feedback Loop
                </h2>

                <p>
                    As the atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water, which is already the most abundant
                    greenhouse gas. This creates a feedback loop that accelerates global warming. It also creates more
                    clouds, rainstorms and other symptoms of climate change. At the poles, the warming of the atmosphere
                    melts the ice cover, exposing water, which is less reflective than ice. The water absorbs the sun's
                    heat, and the oceans also become warmer as a result.

            <p>
                The evidence that humans are causing climate change, with drastic consequences for life on the planet,
                is overwhelming, but the question of what to do about it remains controversial. Economics, sociology,
                and politics are all important factors in planning for the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                A global conversation that began with concern over warming has now turned to the broader term climate
                change, preferred by scientists to describe the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and
                climate systems. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme
                weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts.
                All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the
                atmosphere.
            </p>

            <p>
                Countries around the world acknowledged the imperative to act on climate change with the Paris Agreement
                in 2015, making pledges to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                Change (IPCC), which synthesizes the scientific consensus on the issue, has set a goal of keeping
                warming under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and pursuing an even lower warming cap of 1.5 degrees
                Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).
            </p>

            <p>
                Both of those targets are in jeopardy. Major countries are already falling behind on their pledges,
                according to a UN report issued at the end of 2018, and emissions levels in 2030 need to be
                approximately 25 to 55 percent lower than they were in 2017. Previous research suggests that even if
                countries do meet their pledges to reduce emissions, those commitments won't be enough to stave off
                severe warming.
            </p>

            <h1 class="mt-5">
                What can be done?
            </h1>

            <p>
                Addressing climate change will require many solutions—there's no magic bullet. Yet nearly all of these
                solutions exist today, and many of them hinge on humans changing the way we behave, shifting the way we
                make
                and consume energy. The required changes span technologies, behaviors, and policies that encourage less
                waste and smarter use of our resources. For example, improvements to energy efficiency and vehicle fuel
                economy, increases in wind and solar power, biofuels from organic waste, setting a price on carbon, and
                protecting forests are all potent ways to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases trapping
                heat
                on the planet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scientists are also working on ways to sustainably produce hydrogen, most of which is currently derived
                from
                natural gas, to feed zero-emission fuel cells for transportation and electricity. Other efforts are
                aimed at
                building better batteries to store renewable energy; engineering a smarter electric grid; and capturing
                carbon dioxide from power plants and other sources with the goal of storing it underground or turning it
                into valuable products such as gasoline. Some people argue that nuclear power—despite concerns over
                safety,
                water use, and toxic waste—should also be part of the solution, because nuclear plants don't contribute
                any
                direct air pollution while operating.
            </p>

            <p>
                While halting new greenhouse gas emissions is critical, scientists have also emphasized that we need to
                extract existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. More fanciful ideas for cooling the
                planet—so-called
                “geoengineering” schemes such as spraying sunlight-reflecting aerosols into the air or blocking the sun
                with
                a giant space mirror—have largely been dismissed because they may pose more environmental risks than
                proven
                benefits.
            </p>

            <p>
                But planting trees, restoring seagrasses, and boosting the use of agricultural cover crops could help
                clean up significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Restoring forests already chopped down in Brazil, for
                example, could draw about 1.5 billion metric tons of CO2 out of the air, and a recent study published by
                the National Academies of Science estimates the world’s forests and farms could store 2.5 gigatons.
                Those are relatively modest numbers given historic carbon emissions of 2.2 trillion metric tons, but
                every contribution is needed to curtail the world’s current trajectory.
